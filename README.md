## 📈 Key Results
- Built a **synchronized state‑machine control** loop in C, polling I2C and stepping the motor at 11.25° increments to achieve consistent 1 mm radial resolution scans in real time.
- Achieved ~2 full 360° point-cloud scans per second over a 115,200 bps **UART pipeline**, rendered live in Python with Open3D and NumPy.
- **Improved scan accuracy by nearly 20%** via sensor signal tuning, stepper motor calibration, and **latency reduction** optimizations.
- Demonstrated reliable map outlines of indoor environments, including room and hallway scans, with clear object silhouettes.
- Kept total hardware cost under CA$110, offering **significant cost reduction** compared to entry‑level commercial LiDAR systems.

## 📚 Background
Commercial LiDAR scanners are **expensive and bulky**, limiting their use in educational and budget-conscious prototyping environments. Inspired by a need for **accessible spatial mapping** and **exploring embedded systems**, this project demonstrates how an MSP432E401Y paired with a VL53L1X sensor and a simple stepper can capture 360° distance data for under CA$110.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Stepper & Sensor Control**  
   - MSP432E401Y steps a 28BYJ-48 motor via ULN2003 (stepper motor) at 11.25° increments.  
   - VL53L1X ToF sensor measures distance (up to 4 m) via I2C at each angular position.  
2. **UART Streaming**  
   - The firmware packages millimeter readings into a byte stream at 115,200 bps.  
   - A pushbutton toggles scanning on demand, and LEDs indicate status.  
3. **PC Visualization**  
   - `scanner_visualizer.py` uses `pyserial` to read UART data, converts polar coordinates (angle + distance) to Cartesian points, and renders live 3D slices in Open3D.
   - Automatically simulates forward movement between each 2D scan slice by incrementally translating the point cloud along the scanning axis, generating a continuous 3D representation despite the sensor’s 2D limitations.
